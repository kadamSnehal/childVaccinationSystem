      </div>Vaccination ( or Immunization ) is the process of utilizing the immune system of the body to build antibodies ( either T Cell based of B Cell based ) against the germ that we are trying to protect the body against.
      <div>
        <br></br>
        <div>The procedure involves introducing a small quantity of the same germ in the body as a vaccine. Soon as the body recognizes this germ , the immune system comes into action and builds an antibody response against the germ.
          </div>
          <br></br>
        
        <div>This is quite like a battle where the moment the foreign invader ( the germ ) is recognized , the army ( the immune system) is deployed and the invader is checked at the point of entry before he can spread ( spread of infection ) and cause damage. </div>
        The second time the body is attacked by the germ,the body already has a specific immune response available for the germ.
